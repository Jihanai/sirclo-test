#### 1. What is your design process? Describe your thought process for every step in detail.
Establishing requirements (existing system analysis,  user research and creating persona, create user journey mapping, create recap. of requirement exploration canvas), designing alternatives (create information architecture and design), prototyping, evaluating (usability testing and design evaluation).


1. Existing System Analysis
At this stage will do analysis of the existing system in terms of features, work methods, business processes, target users, existing problems, and business objectives. In addition, at this stage task analysis is made to find out the structure of existing features in detail. One way to identify existing problems is to use eight golden rules consisting of strive for consistency, enable frequent users to use shortcuts, offer informative feedback, easy reversal permits for actions, yield closure dialog design, offer simple error handling, internal support locus of control, and reduce short-term memory load
2. User Research and Creating Persona
User research is conducted to collect data from users to describe the persona that will be created later. Some methods that can be done to collect data include interviews (can be done through unstructured, structured, semi-structured, and focus groups), questionnaires, observations, and document analysis. Data collection or user research can also be carried out system testing by respondents to see specific problems faced by users.
After the data is collected, the existing information is used to create a persona so that the person made will represent the real user. One example of data that is on the persona is a brief description, motivation and purpose of using the system, and difficulties encountered.
3. Create user Journey Mapping
A mapping of problems faced by users is based on task analysis of each feature. At each step carried out by the user identified emotions that occur, difficulties experienced, and opportunities for solutions to be applied.
4. Create Recap. of Requirement Exploration Canvas
at this stage mapping the results of user interviews in the exploration canvas requirement, which consists of tasks (functions or features used to meet user needs), needs (things that are needed and expected by the user when doing tasks), science (difficulties experienced by users when performing tasks). ), usability goals and solutions (usability criteria or principles that must exist and can be used for meet needs), pain reliever (solutions to the difficulties experienced by the user), functionality and improvements (proposed functional improvements based on user needs and difficulties), and potential partners (parties that have the potential to become partners for achieving solutions)
5. Create Information Architecture and Design
Information architecture is created to describe information or tasks that can be performed by the user. In this case, the menus and sub-menus can be used. After that, design was made both in low fidelity and high fidelity until the creation of a clickable prototype.
6. Usability Testing and Design Evaluation
This stage is carried out to check the effectiveness of the designs that have been made previously, as well as evaluate the design performance with assessments that can be System Usability Scale (SUS) or User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ).

### 2. We are confident that you have been making positive impacts on several projects. Please tell us the one project which brings you the most pride and why?
The project that made me proud of it was when I and the team carried out the Indonesian tourism website redesign project for the final assignment on campus. This is because we can do the project for the whole stage while we are also faced with other final project deadlines so that the time allocation for each task is rather small. But we all try our best for the project so that the whole stage can be carried out properly. The design stage (low and high fidelity mockup) only takes 3-4 days with the demands of a detailed process on each feature and must be clickable. After that, we must make report for our redesign process and present it. We did a lot of division of tasks well and register priorities so the results are satisfactory.

## 3. Tell us about your UX project that didn’t go as planned or didn’t deliver, and how did you handle it?
Most of the UX Project that is not running properly based on my experience is caused by insufficient temporary time factor that require a thorough process (including conducting research on users that is quite time consuming). One strategy to overcome this is to do only a few important design stages (considering several priorities on stages and collaborate with others) and conducting research only on certain users but the data is quite useful so that the process carried out remains calculated as comprehensive.

## 4. Please take a moment to observe sirclo.com. Suggest an improvement to the current store creation process, it can be an improvement 
http://bit.ly/TemplatePageImprov
In the link, I redesign template page in term of improvement. I suggest to categorize the templates so the user know what is the categorization for the template. Also, I recommend to make reliable information so the template will be desicionable for the user to make a choice (including rating, description, price)

## 5. How would you verify the effectiveness of your design improvement from the previous question?
The effectiveness of my design improvement before can be verified by seeing how much interactions by the total clicks from user. In addition, usability testing can also be performed on several users who are targeted primarily to see the pain points experienced and what the users need.
